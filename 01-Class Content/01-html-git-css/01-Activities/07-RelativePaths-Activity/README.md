# Instructions

* `git clone`the whole class repo to your local machine. _This way you'll be able to simply `git pull` the class repo for new activities_. 

* Then modify each of the four `html-bio.html` pages such that they can access the CSS inside their folder. Don't move the CSS file, and don't move the HTML file. 

* Use relative linking to make it work!

* Hint: If you need some reading material on relative linking you can use <https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/>.

* If you finish early, please help out those around you, or begin reading through the Learn CSS Layout Guide found here: <http://learnlayout.com/no-layout.html>
