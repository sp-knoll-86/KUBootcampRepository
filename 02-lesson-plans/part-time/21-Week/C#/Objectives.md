# C# Objectives

The first section below enumerates learning objectives specific to C# and ASP.NET.

The second section contains broader learning objectives pertaining to design and best practices, generally.

### .Net learning Objectives

Learning objectives for the C#/ASP.NET unit are given below. After each objective appears the number 1; 2; or 3. The number indicates the "level" of the objective...

* Given a development environment equipped with Visual C# and the .NET framework, students should be able to:

  * Use C# to:

    * Declare variables of the basic types (1)

    * Print output to the console (!)

    * Read user input from the console (1)

    * Safely convert data to and from different data types (1)

    * Store collections of data in Arrays and ArrayLists (1)

    * Store associative data in Dictionaries (1)

    * Take advantage of C#'s type inference to declare variables with `var` (1)

    * Declare and call methods (1)

    * Simulate multiple return values using `out` (1)

    * Use namespaces and `using` statements to organize code (1)

    * Use classes to implement object-oriented architectures (1)

  * Use ASP.NET MVC to:

    * Create controllers that map responses to url routes (1)

    * Use query parameters within routes (1)

    * Create views that correspond to routes (1)

    * Scaffold resource models (1)

    * Validate form input (2)

    * Create one-to-many relationships between models (2/3)

### Design Learning Objectives

* When working on arbitrary projects involving object-oriented design patterns, students should:

  * Implement an MVC-like architecture, even when one is not provided (e.g., raw PHP or in ground-up Node CRUD applications) (3)

  * Sanitize user-input used to create and save models (2)
