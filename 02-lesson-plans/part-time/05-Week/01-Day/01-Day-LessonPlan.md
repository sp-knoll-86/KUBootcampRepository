## 5.1 Lesson Plan - Review Day <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../../04-Week/03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview,

In this class, we will be providing students an opportunity to review old JavaScript activities to gain a stronger foothold in the fundamentals.

`Summary: Review JavaScript & jQuery`

##### Instructor Priorities

* Build student confidence and mastery of concepts covered so far.
* Provide students with an extended opportunity for supported coding.
* Allow students to revisit critical assignments, exercises, and homework covered in class so far.

##### Instructor Notes

* Today's class is one of the few days dedicated exclusively to review in our program. At this point in the program, your students are likely to feel weathered by the JavaScript immersion. Let them know this is their chance to get caught up!

* During today's activities, focus on pairing like-level students so they can review old material with one another. If possible, work with TAs to organize these groups before class begins. Pairing like-levels also helps as it allows you and the TAs concentrate on students who need the most significant help. Consider pulling these students out of class and working with them in another space if one is available.

### Class Objectives

* Students will ask conceptual questions regarding any of the subjects covered so far (HTML, CSS, Git, Github Pages, JavaScript, jQuery)
* Students will absorb a high-level recap of the most important subjects covered to date.
* Students will group code previous or new projects.

### 1. Instructor Do: Cover Day's Agenda (5 minutes)

* Explain to the class that today will be focused on providing an opportunity for review and recalibration. The class will be divided into three sections.
  1. A few moments to answer lingering questions;
  2. A high-level overview of all the major topics covered; and
  3. Two hours of coding in small groups, either redoing select assignments or working on a new project.

### 2. Instructor Do: Collect Student Feedback (10-15 minutes)

* Using Poll Everywhere or a similar anonymous method have students provide open feedback regarding the general subjects or concepts they feel least comfortable with. Be sure to provide adequate time for all students to provide feedback

* Then, offer brief (VERY BRIEF) commentary on the subjects.

* Open the floor to specific questions tied to these subjects

### 3. Instructor Do: Organize Groups (5 minutes)

* Divide the class into pre-defined groups based on personalities and general mastery of the subject so far. Be sure to pair strong students with strong students and weaker students with weaker ones. If possible, this should be done PRIOR to class if possible.

* Have students switch seats and join their defined groups

### 4. Instructor Do: Review (20 minutes)

* Using the [slides](Slide-Shows) provided as a guide, quickly list and explain (at a high-level) the key takeaways students should feel comfortable with at this point in the class. Encourage the class to take note of any topics that remain difficult and to write them down as you speak.

* Be sure to ask individual students questions from time to time to maintain engagement!

* After discussing each section, give the groups a moment to talk to one another and confirm that they understand the topics presented. If there are any issues, encourage them to raise the questions to one another—and if no member of the team can can answer, to then raise it to the class.

* Continue this way until all topics have been covered. Just aim to have at least 2 hours of class time left by the time this recap is complete.

### 5. Instructor Do: Provide Activity Guidelines (5 minutes)

* Task the student groups with choosing one of four different group assignments to work on for the remainder of class. Each group should decide which activity/ies to choose based on the following paradigm.

* Slack out the following instructions:

* **Instructions:**

  * As a group, choose to complete one of the following tasks. Use the information provided below as a guide.

    * Can you and your team comfortably build the Word Guess Game (HW 3) from scratch?

      * No? Then start with Word Guess.

    * Can you and your team conceptually explain how "Captain Planet The Game” works?

      * No? Then start by dissecting "Captain Planet the Game".

    * Can you and your team comfortably use jQuery to modify HTML based on clicks?

      * No? Then start with Lottery Generator.

    * Can you and your team comfortably create a grid-based design with Twitter Bootstrap?

      * No? Then start with the Bootstrap Portfolio assignment.

### 6. Break (15 minutes)

### 7. Students Do: Activities (2 hours)

* Students begin coding. Be sure to encourage them to try coding from scratch if possible. TAs and Instructors should use this time to assist students where needed.
