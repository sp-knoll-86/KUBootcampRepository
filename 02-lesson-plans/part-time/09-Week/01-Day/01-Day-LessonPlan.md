## 9.1 Lesson Plan - Project Work, Pt.1 <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../../08-Week/03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

During this lecture, most of class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check up on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward Saturday's presentations. 

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their project work.

##### Instructor Notes

* Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps before Thursday so they have optimal time to practice their presentations.

* It's **crucial** that you steer any off-course projects back on track. Come next class, the encroaching Saturday deadline will mire any attempt at a turn-around.

  * To that end, you should remind students that they can reach out to you and the TAs for support outside of class.
  * If possible, offer to stay an extra 30 mins to assist your students face-to-face.

* The remaining schedule for Project #1 is as follows:
  * Day 4 (Today)/Day 5:
    * Students are given all of class to work on Projects
  * Day 6:
    * Students present their project!

### Class Objectives

* Provide students more time and support for their group projects.

- - -

### 0. Welcome Class

* Say your hellos and check if students have any questions about past concepts.

### 1. Instructor Do: Ask About Projects (0:05)

* Tell your students how you're excited to see the projects they'll present on Saturday. You should talk about how your impressed with the concepts they've come up with, that they should feel proud about working toward the goals they devised after just spending eight weeks in this course.

  * Assure them that they've come a long way since starting out with just HTML and CSS.

* Ask the class about their thoughts on the collaboration experience so far and about any lingering sources of anxiety they might have as they near closer to presentation day. 	
  * Answer these reassuringly—if you ever had similar doubts, chime in with your experiences on overcoming them.  
  * If no one says anything, they're likely apprehensive about admitting fears to their classmates. Assure them that if they're anxious about their project work, then no doubt other students feel the same way. Encourage them to share these thoughts—talking about them is an essential step to overcoming them.

### 2. Everyone Do: Project Work (1:25)

* Have your students form into their project groups. Tell the class they should try as best they can to finish 95% of their code and design by the end of Wednesday's class. That would give them most of Thursday and Friday to spend on presentations.

  * Add in that they should come into class Wednesday expecting to devote at least 30 minutes to outlining their presentations. They'll also have about 45 minutes to work on the rest of their app.

* TAs and Instructors: For the next 90 minutes, you're Senior Developers! Walk around the class as mentors for each group's team. Ask them about their progress so far; offer them advice on how they can finish their work in time.
  * Maybe a member of the team finished all the work their role entailed. Perhaps they're waiting for other people to complete a certain task before they can continue. Make sure any students in these situations ask their teammates how else they can help.
  * Some students might be stumped by technology that they hadn't gone over in class but are trying to use in their project. See if you can help out. If you're not familiar with the tech, direct the encumbered student to someone on the Boot Camp team who is.
  * In any case, just make sure all teams seem prepared to complete their projects by Saturday.

### 3. BREAK (15 mins)

### 4. Everyone Do: Project Work (1:30)

* Allow students to continue working on their projects.

  * Rotate between groups to offer help to whomever needs it.

* Dismiss class at 9:30.

  * Make yourself and your TAs available for an additional 30 minutes after class, if possible.
