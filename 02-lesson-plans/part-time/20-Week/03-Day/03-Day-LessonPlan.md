## 20.3 Lesson Plan - Review, Homework, Final Projects (10:00 AM) <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; 

### Overview

After doing a review of Databases and React and giving some help and time for students to work on their homework, you'll prime your students to conceptualize their final projects. You'll run down the list of expectations and requirements for each of their weekly deliverables. Aside from that, you and the TAs will stick around to make sure each team has a solid idea for their project--they should have one by the end of the class.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should get time to ask questions and get help reviewing Databases and React content in preparation for their final project.

* Students should get time to work on homework and receive help with any questions they may have.

* Students should know all of their responsibilities for the final project.

* Students should come out of class with a high-level grasp of how their app will function--what does it do and what problem does it solve?

* Students should complete the React Checkpoint.

### Class Objectives

* To lead a review time with your students for any questions they may still have about prior material since their second project. Primarily Databasing and React content.

* To help students with their current homework assignment as it is a hard one!

* To spur students to flesh out some finial project ideas, recruit team members, and figure out what their apps will do.

* To complete the React Checkpoint

### 0. Welcome Class (1 min)

* Say your usual hellos and answer any questions your class might have about the previous class.

### 1. Instructor Do: Lead a review on Databases and React (45 mins)

* We are going to open today's class with a review on some content we have covered since the conclusion of Project 2. Primarily we will be reviewing Databases and React in preparation for your final projects.

* Open the floor to students with specific questions about anything they may not be clear on, including any databasing material or React questions.

* After students have had time to ask specific questions, go into a basic review of Database material.

* After completing your review of Databases, begin a review of the React content that has been covered over the past few classes to make sure students have a solid grasp of the fundamentals for their final project.

### 2. Everyone Do: Work on homework! (30 mins)

* Now its time for students to do some work on their Homework and get help with whatever they may be stuck on!

### 3. Instructor Do: Encouragement (5 mins)

* We are now going to transition away from Databases and React, and spend the rest of class discussing final projects.

* Make sure you open up your school's slide on your computer.

* Start presenting the lecture's Power Point.

* In the first group of slides, you'll congratulate your students for making it as far as they have so far.

  * Remind them that most students had no coding knowhow coming in, but they've learned so much since then (see the list on slide #4).

* Read out some of the goals that your students offered at the beginning of the course (see slide #5).

### 4. Instructor Do: What's Next? (3 mins)

* You'll explain the next few weeks of classes in the next set of slides.

* Tell them about the lectures they can expect, as well as final project presentations and their day with potential employers.

* Announce: no homework for the rest of the course! Well, except for:

  * This week's homework (they still gotta hand that one in).
  * Weekly project deliverables -- more on that soon.

* Tell class that learning doesn't end when they finish the course. There's a literal argosy of languages, frameworks, libraries and other technologies for web developers to study -- and no doubt, this heap of knowledge will build as the years pass.

* Point being: web developers must always teach themselves new skills to stay relevant in this field!

* But add in something along these lines. "No problem! If you learned anything in this boot camp, it's how to grasp these technologies quick &mdash; you're ready for this."

### 5. Instructor Do: Final Project - The Deets (7 mins)

* Go over the next set of slides.

* Tell students should challenge themselves, and that you'll take no excuses. They've made it this far already &mdash; it's time for them to take everything they learned and produce their best work yet (Slides 12 to 16).

* **Go over what's expected for the project:**

  * Whatever they build should have utility.

  * They should have market or real-world research that proves their idea has REAL value to people.

  * They should perform research on other web / mobile applications in their app's domain.

  * They should put serious time and thought into this.

  * They should report problems they're facing along the way.

  * They should use some form of project management system (Jira, Trello and so on).

  * They should dig deep into documentation and external resources to find the tools they need.

* **Go over what's required of each group. Each Project:**

  * Must use ReactJS.

  * Must use a Node and Express Web Server.

  * Must be backed by a MySQL or MongoDB Database with a Sequelize or Mongoose ORM.

  * Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

  * Must be deployed using Heroku (with Data).

  * Must utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.

  * Must allow for or involve the authentication of users in some way.

  * Must have a polished frontend / UI.

  * Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm.

  * Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

* **Finally, go over each week's deliverable**

  * **Week 1**: A detailed plan of action with the following:

    * An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable.

    * A breakdown of roles by group member.

    * A schedule for completion of various tasks.

    * A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.

    * A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.

      * On this note, show Slides 26-27 as an example of a UI/UX and Data Flow layout. Tell the class that you'll expect something akin to these drafts.

  * **Week 2**: A functioning **minimal viable product** (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:

    * A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.

    * A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.

  * **Week 3**: A significantly more polished version of the app.

    * This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.

    * Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.

    * Provide a detailed description of each person's contributions.

    * Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
      * Stretch Features
      * Bugs
      * Enhancements
      * UI Polishing

  * **Week 4**: The Presentation!
    * A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.
    * More on this as we near closer to the end.

### 6. Students Do: Conceptualize the Final App (29 mins)

* When you close the Power Point, direct your students to form into their groups to think about the app they'll create over the next month.

* By the time the class ends, they should tell you the following details about their project:
  * What the app will do.
  * What technologies they expect their app to implement.
  * Who will be responsible for each part of the app.
  * Who will be responsible for each part of deliverable #1.

* Record these responses in a list and make sure each group has given you those four items before they leave class.

* As they're thinking about their apps, you and the TAs should walk the classroom and check in on their progress. Once again, make sure they pick something that will challenge them (but not something so ambitious that it will destroy them).

### 7. BREAK (30 mins)

### 8. Students Do: Finish Conceptualizing And Consider the Next Steps (70 mins)

* Continue along the same path as part 6 until class ends.

* Make sure you go to each group that has yet to submit anything about their app and help them figure out the direction they should move in.
  * If a group can't submit their four items by the end of class, they must at least send them by the end of the day (and really, who wants to work outside of class on a Saturday)?

### 9. Instructor Do: Introduce Checkpoint - React (5 min) (Critical) 

* Let your class know that they will now be taking a short multiple choice assessment to check their understanding of React

* DO NOT SKIP THIS INTRODUCTION. DO NOT JUST SEND OUT THE LINK WITHOUT CONTEXT

* Reassure the students that they need not be nervous about the Checkpoint:

  * "This will not affect your grade or graduation requirements."

  * "This is not like the tests and quizzes you might be used to from school or college. The purpose of these tests is not to motivate you to study or punish you for struggling."

  * "This is as much a test of me as an instructor and of the course content as it is of you. We are here to ensure your success, and this is one of the tools we use to make sure we are doing that effectively. This class moves _fast_, so if some or all of you misunderstand something important we as an instructional team need to find out as fast as possible so we can help."

  * "Long story short, this quiz can not hurt you. Only help you."

* Let students know that they should read carefully and focus on thinking about the right answer rather than using any test-taking skills they may have learned:

  * "There are no silly answers or obvious throwaway responses on this quiz, because those kinds of answers reduce the likelihood that we'll be able to figure out whether we've taught something effectively."

  * "Test taking strategies you may have learned for standardized tests _will not work_, so instead of focusing on eliminating wrong answers or looking for sneaky context cues, read the question and each of the possible choices carefully."

* Reassure students once again that the purpose of this is to help them, and remind them that the outcome does not impact their grade or graduation requirements. You should do this _every single time_ you give an Checkpoint.

* You or your TAs should now get the link specific to your class:

  * Navigate in your browser to: `https://www.switchboard.tech`

  * Select your class code (if it doesn't show up on its own)

    * For parallel cohorts (two classes combined on a Saturday) and doing a Checkpoint: You will **need** to select the classes in your cohort. You can multi select the cards by clicking the class that you need.

    * The class roster will be in the **one** link.

  * Select the Checkpoint and copy the resulting link.

### 10. Students Do: Take Checkpoint - React (10 mins) (Critical)

* Slack out the link to the Checkpoint

* Let your students know that once they select their name, it will take them to the Checkpoint

* Checkpoints must be completed in class, **not at home**, to ensure you will be able to effectively find and help struggling students 

* TAs should walk around the class to ensure students aren't looking up answers

* Keep in mind we do not use grades from assessments toward graduation requirements. However, students will be tempted to avoid feeling like they don't understand something.

* It's important for instructional teams to create an environment where it is safe to fail, but also where such failure is visible. You should not be worried about "cheating" on checkpoints, only making sure that students who need help aren't remaining invisible.

* Your SSM will have the results of the Checkpoint within an hour of its completion

### 11. End (0 mins)

### 12. TAs Do: Structured Office Hours - Review React (30 mins)

* Navigate in your browser to: `https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/checkpoint-bank/blob/master/checkpoints/multiple-choice/10-React-MC/10-ES6-React-MC.md`

* There you will find the questions and answers to the Checkpoint given.

* Please take the entire office hours time to review the questions with the students.

* Suggestion Format:

  * TAs ask a question at a time to the class.

  * Let the students try to answer it.

    * If you see that a majority of the class has a misunderstanding with a question:

      * Take your time on this question!

    * If you see that a small number of students has a misunderstanding with a question:

      * Do your best to reinforce the misunderstanding but be cautious of your time.

      * Make note of the students that are still struggling with the question and schedule a 1:1 with the students.

  * If applicable, demo the answer.

* Take your time on these questions!

* This is a great time to reinforce concepts and misunderstandings!

# Instructor Do: Private Self-Reflection (0 mins)

Take some time on your own after class to think about the following questions. If there's anything that you're not sure how to answer, feel free to reach out to the curriculum team!

1. How did today's class go?
2. How did you teach it?
3. How well do you feel you did teaching it?
4. Why are you teaching it?
5. Why did you teach it that way?
6. What evidence can I collect to show my students are understanding?
7. How will my students know they are getting it?
