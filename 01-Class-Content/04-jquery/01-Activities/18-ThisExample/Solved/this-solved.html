  <h1>Make sure to view the console to see the action!</h1>

  <script type="text/javascript">

    // EXAMPLE ONE:
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "this" going to print?

    // Answer: "WINDOW"
    // Explanation: In this case "this" references the window (since it isn't inside of any object).
    console.log(this);


    // EXAMPLE TWO:
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "this" going to print?

    // Answer: "WINDOW"
    // Explanation: Again, in this case 'this' references the window, since it isn't tied to any specific object.
    function myFunction() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    myFunction();

    // EXAMPLE THREE (IMPORTANT):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "someObj.say()" going to print?

    // Answer: "Red Hat"
    // Explanation: "someObj.say()" will print "this.name", which in this case references the "someObj" object.
    var someObj = {
      name: "Red Hat",
      say: function() {
        console.log(this.name);
      }
    };
    someObj.say();


    // EXAMPLE FOUR (BONUS, TRICKY!):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "myObj.yell()" going to print? Why?

    // Answer: "Object > name: 'Star Powerup'"
    // Explanation: Very tricky one!
    // In this case, one would think the output should be: "Object > name: 'Blue Shell".
    // However, in this case, the keyword: "this" changes meaning mid-way through the function call.
    // At first "this" refers to "myObj", but as we go inside the "changeName" function "this" means "Window".
    // The takeaway here is that one needs to be ultra careful of one's use of the keyword: "this".
    var myObj = {
      name: "",
      yell: function() {
        this.name = "Star Powerup";

        var changeName = function(newName) {
          this.name = newName;
          console.log("`this` refers to the window here, because this nested function loses the myObj scope. console.log(this):");
          console.log(this);
          console.log("so we're setting the name '" + newName + "' on the window. console.log(window.name):");
          console.log(window.name);
          console.log("`window` contains the global scope, so you can log the variable itself. console.log(name):");
          console.log(name);
        };
        changeName("Blue Shell");
        console.log("`this` here refers to myObj, so doesn't show our modifications to window");
        console.log(this);
      }
    };
    myObj.yell();


    // EXAMPLE FIVE (BONUS, TRICKY!):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "myObj.yell()" going to print? Why?

    // Answer: "Object > name: 'Blue Shell'"
    // Explanation: This example "solves" the issue from the previous bonus.
    // In order to maintain scope throughout the function we created a variable called: "thisObject".
    // This "thisObject" variable latches onto the original "myObj" instance of "this" to preserve state.
    // Now, we can use the object "thisObject" in our "changeName" function to set the new name.
    // Tricky indeed! Don't worry if you don't quite get it. This is more of a theoretical challenge.
    var myObj = {
      name: "",
      yell: function() {

        // Here we make use of the "thisObject" variable to hold the state of "this"
        var thisObject = this;

        this.name = "Star Powerup";
        var changeName = function(newName) {
          thisObject.name = newName;
        };
        changeName("Blue Shell");
        console.log(thisObject);
      }
    };
    myObj.yell();
