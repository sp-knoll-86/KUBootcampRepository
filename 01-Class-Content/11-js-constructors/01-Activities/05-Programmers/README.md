# **Instructions**

* In this activity, we are going to create a constructor function called "Programmer" which can be used to create objects containing information on various programmers.

* Your "Programmer" constructor should be able to take in the following information...

  * The programmer's name
  * Their position/job title
  * How old they are
  * Favorite programming language

* Now create a method for the constructor that would print all of the information contained within an object to the console.

* Finally, create a "Programmer" object and call the method to print its contents
