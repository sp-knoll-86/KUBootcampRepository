# **Instructions**

* In this activity we are going to make two constructors in two different files in which one constructor calls upon the other within it.

* The first constructor function is called "Student" and has the following properties within it...

  * Name of the student
  * Favorite subject
  * Current GPA

* The second constructor function is called "Classroom" and has and has the following properties within it...

  * An array of students within the class
  * Number of students in the class
  * Name of the professor
  * Room number
  * The Student constructor function from above which adds a new student to the class

* BONUS: Make it so that that your application can take in user input to add new classes and new students to those classes.

* HINT: For the bonus, make sure that the number of students in the class is updated as you add new students
