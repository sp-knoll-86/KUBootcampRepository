# Mocha Refresher

In this activity we will write a function for calculating tax, and then writing tests afterwards to verify its functionality.

## Instructions

* Complete the `calculateTax` function inside of `tax.js`.

* The function should take 1 parameter that represents the price of the object.

* The function should return the total price with 8% tax (`price * 1.08`).

* The total price should be formatted as a dollar amount (ex: 4.20).

* In a separate file, use mocha and chai to test the function. It should return the proper total for a given price if the price is a number or throw an error if price is not a number. 

### Hints

* Reference the code from last class if needed.
