# Instructions

* Put all of this code inside a folder named `week1-day2-html-css`, and put the folder in a place where you normally code. 
* Use the command line to make a folder called `css`.
* Use the command line to make a file called `style.css` inside of thee `css` folder.
* Reference the `style.css` in your `student-bio.html` file. You do this by placing `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">` inside the `<head>` tag.
* Style the example on the projector.
  * Add a `class` called "container" on the `div` tag.
  * Add an `id` called "main-bio" for the first `section` tag.
  * Add an `id` called "contact-info" for the second `section` tag.
  * Add an `id` called "bio-image" for the bio image.
* Style specs:

  * `body`
    * The background color is `#efeee7`.
    * The font used `"Georgia",Times New Roman,Times,serif;`.
    * The font color is `#333333`.
    * Be sure to zero out the body margins and padding so the page is flush to the top of the page:
      ```css
      body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }
      ```
  * `header`
    * The background color is `#333333`.
  * `h1`
    * The font color is `#eee`.
    * The font size is `28px`.
    * Look at the example on the screen, and eyeball the padding and/or margins and positioning of the text.
  * `h2`
    * The font size is `24px`
  * Make the container have a width of 1024 pixels, and center it. You do this using `margin: 0 auto;`.
  * Make `#main-bio`, `#contact-info`, `#bio-image` all `float: left`.
  * Make the `#bio-image` have a width of 200 pixels.
  * Be sure to include `alt` text in all images
  * `#main-bio` should have a width of `70%`.
    * Add margins to the image so there is distance between it and the bio text.
  * `#contact-info` should have a width of `30%`.
  * Adjust the line height so it is 1.5 times the size of the font.
  * Make the link color `#d21034`.

  * Stage, commit, and push this new file to Github.
