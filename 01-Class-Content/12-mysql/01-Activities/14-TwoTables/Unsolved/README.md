# **Instructions**

* When dealing with big databases, it is very likely that you will have to work with two or more datasets that are related, but which have some degree of separation between them. In this case we have a table of the top 5000 songs and a table of the top 3000 albums.

  * Emphasize the relationship between databases and tables: Tables live **in** databasesâ€”i.e., databases consist of tables.

  * A **table** is a set of rows and columns. This set of rows and columns itself is _not_ a "database". We might, however, have a database that consists of only a single table, but there remains a conceptual distinction between the database and the table.

* It is your task to take these two large sets of data and come up with a method to join them together in order to figure out if a given artist's song and album made it into the charts at the time of their release.

  * HINT: This can be done in a couple different ways using external data as well, but you do have all of the data you need within your database to find the correlations. Give your methods some though before having to rely upon external info.

  * HINT: Remember that MySQL has the ability to combine two or more tables together so long as they share equivalent data. What data is similar between the two lists?

* Once you have managed to successfully bring the two datasets together, start making queries like those you made earlier to this new table as well.
