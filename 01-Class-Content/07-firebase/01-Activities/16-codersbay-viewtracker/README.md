# Coder's Bay - View Tracker

## File

* [`logic`](Unsolved/logic.js)

## Instructions

* Using `logic.js` as a starting point, incorporate view tracking using Firebase on the backend.

* **HINT:** `.set()` overwrites everything in the specified directory, so we will need to use `.ref()` to store bidder data and connections in different folders.
