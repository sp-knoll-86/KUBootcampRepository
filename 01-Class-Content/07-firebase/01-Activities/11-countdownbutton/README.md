# Count Down Button

## Files

* [`logic`](Unsolved/logic.js) or [`logicOption2`](Unsolved/logicOption2.js)

## Instructions

* Using either `logic.js` (easier) or `logicOption2.js` (harder), create the click down activity using a Firebase database to store the click data on the backend.

* Your application should be able to run on multiple browser windows simultaneously and register click events on each screen correctly.
