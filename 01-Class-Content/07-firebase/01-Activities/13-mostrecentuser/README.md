# Most Recent User

## File

* [`recentuser`](Unsolved/recentuser.html)

## Instructions

* Using the file above as a starting point, create an app that stores each new user in a Firebase database.

* Your app should update in real time - if multiple browsers windows are open to the app at the same time, they should all update with the new information if a new user is added.
