# Constructors to Classes

In this activity we will be converting what was previously a constructor into new, ES6 class syntax.

## Instructions

* Open [DigitalPal.js](Unsolved/DigitalPal.js), look through and run the code.

* This example uses a constructor function that is able to create `DigitalPal` objects.

* Convert this example to utilize the ES6 class syntax.

* The code should still function the exact same way after it's updated.

### Hints

* Check out the [MDN documentation for ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
