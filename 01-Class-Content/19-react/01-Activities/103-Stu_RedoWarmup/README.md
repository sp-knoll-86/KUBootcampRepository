# Redo Warmup

In this activity we will convert a JavaScript file using `var` to use `const` and `let` instead.

## Instructions

* Open [function-scoped.js](Unsolved/function-scoped.js)

* Convert all of the `var` identifiers in this file to use either `const` or `let`, without breaking the code.

### Hints

* Remember, both `const` and `let` are block scoped.

* `const` should be used for any values which won't be reassigned, `let` should be used for values that will be reassigned.
