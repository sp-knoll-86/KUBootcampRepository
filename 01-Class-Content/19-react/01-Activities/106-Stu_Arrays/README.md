# Arrays

In this activity we will replace imperative for-loops with functional implementations.

## Instructions

* Strings aren't the only thing that have some nifty features we haven't explored yet.

* In this activity, you'll research new array methods and try to use them to accomplish tasks.

* Go through and update each example in [arrays.js](Unsolved/arrays.js) to utilize the array method specified in the comments place of the for-loop.

## Hints

* See [MDN documentation for Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

* See [MDN documentation for Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

* See [MDN documentation for Array.prototype.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=b)
