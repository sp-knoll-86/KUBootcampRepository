# ES5 Debug

In this activity we will fix a bug in a small JavaScript project using ES5 by using `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

## Instructions

* Let's look at another example of ES5. Open up [tacos.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/19-react/01-Activities/104-Stu_ES5Debug/Unsolved/tacos.html) and click on each of the buttons displayed.

* This code doesn't behave as expected (the buttons shouldn't all behave the same way).

* Discuss with your partner: How/why doesn't this behave as expected?

  * Attempt to find the cause of the bug and then use your new found knowledge of ES6 to correct it.

### Bonus

* Update all instances of string concatenation (e.g. `var name = name + " Zuckerberg") to use string template literals instead. This is a new feature we'll go over next, but check out [MDN's documentation on string template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to see if you can figure it out early.
