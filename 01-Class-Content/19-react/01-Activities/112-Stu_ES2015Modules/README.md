# ES2015 Modules

In this activity we will update an example to use ES2015 modules.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved](./Unsolved) and go through the code in each file.
* Update each file to import or export the data specified in the comments.

## Hints

* Remember, at the moment ES2015 modules aren't supported in Node without Babel. Run the `index.js` file using the `babel-node index.js`.

* Check out [MDN's documentation on import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)

* Check out [MDN's documentation on export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
