# Student Do: Create a Kanban Board

* In this activity you will create your own Kanban Board for managing your project and add some cards.

## Instructions

* Use the `Projects` tab in GitHub to create a new project (use the automated Kanban template).

* Add a new column called Icebox (You will need to exit the "add card" pop-up to access the "add column" area on the right side).

* Click "+ Add Cards" and dragging each issue into the correct column, To Do or Icebox.

### Bonus

* If you have extra time, let each team member add some additional features to the Icebox. This is a great place to hold future enhancement ideas. Remember that each feature may need to be broken down into smaller tasks in the future before you open issues and start building them.
