# Create Repository

In this activity we will create a group project repo and add group members as collaborators.

## Instructions

* One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.

* Protect the repo's master branch as we did during project 1.

  * Once at the repo's page, click the "Settings" tab.

  * Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

  * Under "Branch protection rules", choose "master" from the dropdown.

  * Check off the following options:

    * "Protect this branch"

    * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

    * "Include administrators"

    * "Require status checks to pass before merging"

    * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
  
  * Click "Save changes"

* Once complete, invite the other group members as collaborators.

### Hints

* Make sure each invited group member checks their email and accepts the invitation.

* Ask an instructor or TA if you get stuck!
