## Bonus

* If you finish early, read about [TypePlate - http://typeplate.com/](http://typeplate.com/) and see if you can figure out how to incorporate it into your site. 

* If you still finish early, spend some time trying to actually make the page look nice. Think about what's aesthetically pleasing and push yourself to create it.
