# Student Do: GitHub Issues

* In this activity you will create an Issue on GitHub utilizing the template provided.

## Instructions

* Start by listing the tasks involved in completing each of your user stories.

* Once you have 1-5 tasks written up for each user story, open a GitHub issue for each task by clicking on `Issues` and the green `New Issue` button.

Use the template below, replacing the user stories and acceptance criteria with your own.

```
## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to input search queries so that I can search Stack Overflow when I'm stuck.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] index.html has a text input
- [ ] index.html has a search button
```

* **This is a critical task.** Don't be afraid to ask instructional staff for help during this part. Make sure that each task is clear and everyone on the team understands how to implement each one. 

As an example:

In a dating website application...

**User Story**: As a user I want to see my closest match, so that I can meet someone with whom I share interests.

* **BAD TASK**: 
1. On new member form submit, find and display best match.

* **GOOD TASKS**: 
1. build a form that captures user scores (1-5) to ten questions. 
2. On submit, save the ten numerical answers to as an array.
3. Compare the user array to each existing user array and find the closest match.
4. Display the closest match to the user.
