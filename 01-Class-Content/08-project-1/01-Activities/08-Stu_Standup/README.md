## Students Do: First Stand-up

* In this activity you will take part in your first stand-up with your group mates. This will make sure everyone is on the same page with what they are working on and everyone gets help they might need.

## Instructions

* Before your first stand-up, each member of the team should go through the To Do column of the Project Board and self-assign at least one issue. 

  * To do this, click on the issue and on the right choose "self-assign".

* Everyone should have a clear idea of what they intend to accomplish today. Now it's time for your first stand-up!

* Stand if you are able - yep, stand-ups take place standing; this helps to ensure that the meetings are short and to the point. 

* Each member of the team should say what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and what, if anything, is blocking their progress. 

* Stand-ups should be held **daily** from this point forward - yes even days that you don't have class (use Slack).
