## Updated Portfolio Page

### Overview

Now that you've had some practice with HTML and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.

### Before you Begin

* Pin some repos that you want to share

  * Navigate to your [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=repositories)

  * Click "Customize your pinned repositories"

  * Click the "Repositories you contribute to" checkbox (this will allow you to "pin" Project 1 even if you aren't the "owner")

  * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

* Revisit your portfolio page

  * Open up your old portfolio page

  * Read through the rest of the homework requirements and decide whether you can update your existing portfolio page or if you want to start fresh now that you've had some more HTML/CSS practice (you may also want to change it to be a single page instead of multiple pages or you might even want to consider using a paid theme)

### Required: Update your Portfolio Site -- Employer Ready

To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you should meet the following
content and design requirements. These are aligned with what you will need to be
[employer ready](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Content

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

#### Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements
to ensure your portfolio site will help you be [employer competitive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Competitive Content

* At least 3 deployed projects

* External content:

  * Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

  * Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
  how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

  * Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

#### Competitive Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.

* Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
