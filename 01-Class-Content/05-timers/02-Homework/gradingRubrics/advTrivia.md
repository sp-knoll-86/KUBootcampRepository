### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed, the student receives a D.

If the student submitted a homework but nothing works or functions, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

Students should receive this grade **only** if they submit an empty repository. If the student attempted the homework assignment and was simply unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a normal letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
