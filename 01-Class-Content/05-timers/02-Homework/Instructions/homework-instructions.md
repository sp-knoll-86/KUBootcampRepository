# JavaScript Assignment 2

### Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Before You Begin

1. Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3. Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5. Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

   * In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
   * In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
   * In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

6. Choose a game to build from your options below. 

### Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

**[Click Here to Watch the demo](advanced-trivia-demo.mov)**.

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS
