# Reverse in Place w/Palindrome Detector

## File

* [`app`](Unsolved/app.js)

## Instructions

* A palindrome is a sentence that reads the same backwards and forwards: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

* Reverse each word in a sentence and display it on the screen in the same order. For example, the sentence `This is an example` would become `siht si na elpmaxe`. If the sentence is a palindrome, have it display in red.

* **NOTE:**

  * Remove periods.

  * Add the result to the page in the div with the id "Result".

* **BONUS:**

  * Remove all "special characters" (commas, periods, etc).

  * Do not use the reverse() method.

* Here are some test phrases to put in your JavaScript:

  * "Otto bought a racecar he cannot afford."

  * "Otto lost the deed to his house."

  * "Otto needs Xanax."
