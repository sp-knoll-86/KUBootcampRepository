// Reverse in Place w/Palindrome Detector


// Instructions
// ============

// A palindrome is a sentence that reads the same backwards and forwards:
// "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

// Reverse each word in a sentence
// and display it on the screen in the same order.

// For example, the sentence "This is an example"
// would become `siht si na elpmaxe.`

// If the word is a palindrome, have it display in red.


// Notes:
// ======

// Remove periods.
// Add the result to the page in the div with the id "Result".
// Here are some test phrases to put in your JavaScript:
// "Otto bought a racecar he cannot afford."
// "Otto lost the deed to his house."
// "Otto needs Xanax."


// Bonus:
// ======

// Remove all "special characters" (commas, periods, etc).
// Do not use the reverse() method.
