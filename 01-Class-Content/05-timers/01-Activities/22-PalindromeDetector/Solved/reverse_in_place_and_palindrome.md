# Reverse in Place w/Palindrome Detector

## Instructions

A palindrom is a sentence that reads the same backwards and forwards: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Reverse each word in a sentence and display it on the screen in the same order. For example, the sentence `This is an example` would become `siht si na elpmaxe`. If the word is a palindrome, have it display in red.

* Notes:

  * Remove periods.
  * Add the result to the page in the div with the id "Result".

* Bonus:
  * Remove all "special characters" (commas, periods, etc).
  * Do not use the reverse() method.


* Here are some test phrases to put in your JavaScript:
  * "Otto bought a racecar he cannot afford."
  * "Otto lost the deed to his house."
  * "Otto needs Xanax."
