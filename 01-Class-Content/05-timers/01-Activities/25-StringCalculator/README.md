# String Calculator

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Write a text based calculator. The calculator will take strings in this format:

  * `Add 2 and 4`
  * `Subtract 3 from 5`
  * `Divide 6 by 2`
  * `Multiply 3 by 7`

* The calculator will then calculate and `return` the answer.

* You only need to handle `subtract`, `add`, `divide`, and `multiply`.

* **BONUS:**

  * Use a `switch` statement.

  * If a user enters a string not in the above format, return a error message that tells them what they did wrong.
