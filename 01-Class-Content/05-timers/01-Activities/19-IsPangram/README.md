## Instructions

A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once. For example: `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`

* Write a function that takes a string and determines whether the string is a pangram, **without** typing out the full alphabet anywhere in your code.

* **BONUS:** Handle punctuation in the sentence.
