 * BRIEF //
 *   Your firm is implementing its student management prototype in C#.
 *   It's a command-line program, which the registrar's office will use to
 *   add students to the database upon enrollment.
 *
 *   The program should prompt the user for a student's first name; last name;
 *   middle initial; physical address; email address; and phone number.
 *
 *   After each prompt, the program should wait for the user's input.
 *
 *   Once the user has entered every piece of information, the program should
 *   print it all back to the console, and prompt the user to enter 'Y' if the
 *   information is correct, or any other key otherwise.
 *
 *   For now, you should collect the user's response--i.e., 'Y' or otherwise--but
 *   don't worry about handling it. We'll get to that shortly.

// What function prints a message to the screen and waits for user input?
// Use it here to collect a student's information--first name, last name, etc.

// ...Your Code Here...

// Once you've gotten all of that, print it all back to the screen.

// Then, use the same function you used to prompt users for information to ask
// them to confirm whether or not the information is correct. Save their
// response, but don't worry about doing anything with it yet!
