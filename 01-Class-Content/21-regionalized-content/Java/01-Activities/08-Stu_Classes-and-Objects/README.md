# Classes and Objects

In this activity we will get some practice creating and using classes.

## Instructions

* Create a Student class. It should have private String fields corresponding to the keys being used in the student HashMap. Give this Student class a report method that prints all of the attributes.

* Create a Roster class. This is just a simple wrapper around the `ArrayList<Student>`. Give it a report method that, in turn, calls the report method of each student in the list.

* Refactor your code to use these new classes and methods.

### Hints

* Don't forget to compile your classes against the right classpath!

* Check out the [Java documentation on Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)
