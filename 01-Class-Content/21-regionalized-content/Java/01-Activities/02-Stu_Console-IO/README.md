# ConsoleIO

In this activity we will work with user input and log data to the console using Java.

## Instructions

* Open [ConsoleIO.java](Unsolved/console/ConsoleIO.java).

* Add code to accomplish the following:

  * Using the built-in [Scanner class](https://www.javatpoint.com/Scanner-class), prompt the user for their first name and store it in a String variable. Repeat this process for the user's phone number, middle name, and last name.

  * Once you have all of the information, print each value to the console using [System.out.println](http://www.sitesbay.com/java/java-system-out-println) and [String.format](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22416578/how-to-use-string-format-in-java).

  * Finally, print a message asking the user if this is the correct information. Store the response, but don't do anything with it yet.

* Test your code by compiling and running it with the following:

* While in the same directory as [ConsoleIO.java](Unsolved/console/ConsoleIO.java), run the following commands to compile and run your code:

  ```
  javac *.java
  java -cp ../ console.ConsoleIO
  ```

## Hints 

* Read up on the [Scanner class](https://www.javatpoint.com/Scanner-class) to work with user input.

* Read up on [System.out.println](http://www.sitesbay.com/java/java-system-out-println) for printing to the console.
