/* ****************************************************************************
 *
 * BRIEF //
 *
 *   Your firm is implementing its student management prototype in Java.
 *   It's a command-line program, which the registrar's office will use to
 *   add students to the database upon enrollment.
 *
 *   The program should prompt the user for a student's first name; last name;
 *   middle initial; physical address; email address; and phone number.
 *
 *   After each prompt, the program should wait for the user's input.
 *
 *   Once the user has entered every piece of information, the program should
 *   print it all back to the console, and prompt the user to enter Y if the
 *   information is correct, or any other key otherwise.
 *
 *   For now, you should collect the user's response--i.e., y or otherwise--but
 *   don't worry about handling it. We'll get to that shortly.
 *

     *   name; address; email; and phone number (which you'll store as a
     *   String).

    /* Once you've gotten all the information, print the value of each

     *   substitution. */

     *   Collect their response in a variable called confirmation. Don't do
     *   anything with it yet, though. */
