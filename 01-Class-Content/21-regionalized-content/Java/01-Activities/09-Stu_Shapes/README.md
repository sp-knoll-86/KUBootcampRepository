# Shapes

In this activity we will review classes in Java.

## Instructions

* Your task for this activity is to build two classes: `Triangle` and `Square`. We'll assume that our classes are all "regular" shapes &mdash; i.e., their sides are all the same length. Users should be able to call three—and only three—methods on each shape: `area`, `perimeter`, and `getSides`.

* Each class should have a field, called `sideLength`, which records the length of its sides. Should this field be `static`? Should it be `private` or `public`?

* Each class should have a field, called `sides`, which keeps track of how many sides it has. Should this field be `static`? Should it be `private` or `public`?

* Each class should have a method, called `area`, which uses the shape's side length to calculate its area. Feel free to Google the formula.

* Each class should have a method, called `perimeter`, which uses the shape's side length to calculate its perimeter. Feel free to Google the formula.

* When you're done implementing, execute the `run.sh` script (`bash run.sh` on mac) to make sure everything works as expected.

* Take a look at the `getHeight` method in your `Triangle` class. Should this be `private` or `public`?

* Take a moment to think about your solutions. Is there anything unsatisfying about them? What would be better than what you have?
