# Functions

In this activity we will refactor the student information tool to be more modular through the use of functions.

## Instructions

* Create a function that prompts a user for a piece of a student's information and stores their response in a HashMap.

* Create a function that accepts and prints a confirmation message, and returns the value the user enters as confirmation.

* Create a function that accepts a list of student HashMaps and prints all the keys/values of each one.

* Wrap the code that creates the student HashMap up into a function that returns the HashMap.

* Wrap the code that asks the user for information up into a function.

* Wrap the code that asks the user for confirmation up into a function and return the result.

* Wrap the code that logs each student's values up into a function.
